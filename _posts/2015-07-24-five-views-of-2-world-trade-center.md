description: "BIG's shape-shifting, stacked tower design for 2 WTC fills in the monolithic, corporate campus of the World Trade Center complex when viewed from the south. Seen from the north, it wants to suggest the varied cityscape of Tribeca, and from Brooklyn may look, for better or worse, like a giant bunch of children's blocks, about to tumble over."
